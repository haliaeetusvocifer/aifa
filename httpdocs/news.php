					<p>The issue of a dwindling reading culture among the youth came to the fore recently at the 2017 Little Writers Awards organised by ALFA Reading Society for Junior and Senior Secondary Schools in Lagos. The yearly event, held at Oriental Hotel, Lagos, was another bold effort by the society, a not-for-profit organisation committed to the promotion of reading culture and the attainment of sustainable educational development across Africa.</p>
					
					<p>President of the society and Dean, Lagos Business School, Dr. Enase Okonedo, said the event, opened to junior and senior secondary schools in Lagos, was the high point of activities organised yearly to address the declining reading culture. Stressing that poverty has denied many students access to reading materials, she urged the youth to go back to reading to develop and broaden their minds for development.</p>

					<p>According to her, recent study has shown that 40 per cent of Nigeria graduates do not read after school. Okonedo expressed happiness with the acceptance of the yearly Little Writers’ Awards, with the increasing number of schools participating, thereby promoting reading.<p>
					<p>The society, she said, also embarked on a yearly book drive to encourage reading among pupils. Expounding on the theme ‘Reviving the Reading Culture: A Prerequisite for Self and National Development,’ Principal Consultant of Discover Your Potential Ltd, Dr. Kunbi Wuraola, said when one cannot read, he cannot write well and if one don’t write well, one cannot speak well. She stressed that everyone has a role to play to revive reading culture in the society.</p>

						<p>Some participants at the Little Writers Competition organised by AIFA Reading Society have emerged victorious.</p>
						<p>The winners were celebrated at a ceremony themed, ‘Reviewing the Reading Culture: A Prerequisite for Self and National Development’, held in Lagos. In the teachers’ category, Ajani Oluyemi from Girls’ Junior Academy, Lagos Island , emerged the winner while Onaneye Salewa of Lafiaji Senior High School, Lagos Island, and  Martins Odiagbe of Magbon-Alade Senior Grammar School, emerged in the second and third positions respectively.</p>
						
						<p>In the senior school category, Okonkwo Chidinma of Okesuna Senior High School, Lagos Island, emerged first while Alfred Ini-Obong of Ajeromi Ifelodun Senior High School, and Anani Faustina of Magbon-Alade Senior Grammar School bagged the second and third positions respectively.</p>
 						
 						<p>President of the society, Dr. Enase Okonedo, explained that the competition was organised to encourage reading. She commended teachers in public schools for their roles in sustaining reading culture.
						“Over 40 per cent of pupils that left school these days no longer read. However, we must commend our teachers for trying their best to sustain reading. Reading is something we all must be involved in. We must support and promote reading habits in pupils,” she added.</p>
						
						<p>While delivering an address, Dr. Kunbi Wuraola, encouraged pupils to make reading a habit. She told them that reading expanded possibilities of being successful, urging that guardians must assist in making reading convenient. “Everybody has a role to play. As long as you know one young person, you should be involved. Parents, teachers, community and religious centres must take the encouragement of reading activities as a necessity,” she said.
						Speaking on behalf of the winners, Chidinma Okonkwo hailed the organisers for eliciting reading interest in them. She urged the winners and participants not to relent in writing and reading.</p>

                         <p>In the Society’s effort to promote a sustainable framework for the development of education in Nigeria, the Society undertook its project tagged ‘Calculate2Succeed’ which is geared towards empowering students in public schools with the tools necessary to excel in mathematics and science subjects.</p>

                         <p>The importance of excelling in the field of mathematics cannot be overemphasized in our technologically driven world. This is more so in view of the fact that Mathematics is a compulsory subject offered in Nigerian schools and taught daily in all schools at least four times in a week. The benefits of a sound understanding of mathematics for students include the opportunity to develop lifelong learning skills like logical thinking, organization, problem solving capabilities and good work ethics which will ultimately have a positive impact on their career plan.</p>

                         <p>Representatives and a member of the Society, Ms. Oludolapo Makinde visited four (4) public schools in Lagos state with instructional materials to motivate and sustain their interest in mathematics learning as well as facilitate their understanding of the subject. The ‘Calculate2Succeed’ project was supported by Mrs. Chioma Mordi and through this project the Society was able to impact one thousand one hundred and eighty (1180) students in Lagos state with branded mathematical sets. The beneficiaries of this project include; Ifako Comprehensive Junior Grammar School, Lafiaji Comprehensive Senior Secondary School, Ojoku Memorial Junior High School, and Surulere Girls Senior Secondary School.</p>

                         <p>It is the Society’s hope that this project will help foster excellence in public secondary schools in Nigeria by supporting the students with basic instructional materials needed to help them succeed and reach their full potentials.</p>

                         <p>The Society’s primary focus has been to promote the adoption of best reading practices across Africa. In line with this, the Society organized a book drive campaign to address the lack of educational materials in Government school libraries. This drive was an initiative to promote a reading culture among children and youth.</p>

                         <p>Through this campaign, the Society received reading materials with the support of individuals who donated towards the project. The books received included; educational text books cutting across all subjects like Mathematics, English Language, Government, Economics, Basic Science, Biology etc. Among notable donations were Classic African Literature novels from our finest authors <i>(Things Fall Apart/Arrow of god by Chinua Achebe, The gods are Not to Blame by Ola Rotimi, The African Child by Camara Laye etc.)</i>, Non-African Classic Literature novels <i>(Twelfth Night by Williams Shakespeare, Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens etc)</i> to say the least. </p>

                         <p>The Society’s team of volunteers visited Ifako Comprehensive Senior High School, Ifako-Gbagada and Girls Junior Secondary Grammar School, Ikoyi on Friday, October 21, 2016 to give the gift of reading to students and teachers of these schools by donating the reading materials received to the schools’ libraries.</p>

                         <p>The Society’s team of volunteers advised the students on why it is important to develop the rudiments of reading and the culture of reading always so as to survive in life as it adds quality to life and provides access to culture and cultural heritage. Ms. Arogundade added that reading experience can be obtained in the library. She also remarked that the school library is a gateway to knowledge and will serve as a starting point or road map for reading and the promotion of a reading culture.</p>
